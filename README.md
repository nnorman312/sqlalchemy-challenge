Surf's Up!

I decided to treat myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with my trip planning, I do some climate analysis on the area. 

Climate Analysis and Exploration

1. Precipitation Analysis
- Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data
- Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame
- Plot the results using the DataFrame plot method
- Use Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data

2. Station Analysis
- Design a query to calculate the total number of stations in the data
- Design a query to find the most active stations
- Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS)
- Filter by the station with the highest number of observations
- Plot the results as a histogram

Climate App

- Design a Flask API based on the queries that I developed

Bonus

Trip Average Temp
- Use the calc_temps function to calculate the min, avg, and max temperatures for my trip using the matching dates from the previous year 
- Plot the min, avg, and max temperature from my previous query as a bar chart

Daily Normals
- Calculate the daily normals (averages for the min, avg, and max temperatures) 
- Load the list of daily normals into a Pandas DataFrame
- Use Pandas to plot an area plot for the daily normals
